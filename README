RNAStructProfiling

To download source code, click on "zip" link on the RNAStructProfiling github
page (https://github.com/gtfold/RNAStructProfiling/zipball/gtboltzmann).

To compile on a Unix/Linux machine, make sure the following files are in the
same directory:
--main.c
--profile.h
--profile.c
--summaryGraph.c
--summaryGraph.h
--hashtbl.c
--hashtbl.h
--Makefile
--graph.c
--graph.h
--memoryDFS.c
--memoryDFS.h
--libgtfold.a
--include folder with header files

Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory that contains
the above files, and type 'make' to compile the program.

To run, you will need to input a sequence file, and optionally a
structure file either in sfold (using -sfold option) or in gtboltzmann 
(using -e option) format.

Usage (from within that same directory): 
./RNAprofile [options] [seq file] 

Common options:
-v = verbose output that gives all helix classes and profiles with frequencies
-h [percent] = filter out all helix classes that occur in less than [h] percent
 of the input sample structures
-p [percent] = filter out all profiles that occur less than [p] percent of the
 input sample structures
-g = disable graph making component of program (if only interested in helix and
 profile stats)
-o [file name] = produces the output graphviz dot file called [file name];
 'profile.dot' used by default
-e [file] gtboltzmann style structure file as input
-sfold [file] Sfold style structure file as input
